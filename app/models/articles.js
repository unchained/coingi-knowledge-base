                        If you've placed an order to buy or sell a certain currency but don't see the right amount in
                        your account's balance list, there's <strong>no need to worry</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you place an order on any currency exchange, the money is not instantly added or deducted
                        from your balance. Instead, the order is added to the order book, waiting to be filled by other
                        users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       This means that if you wan't to buy some Bitcoin, there has to be someone else on the opposite
                       side, wanting to sell his Bitcoin to you and vice versa. We highly recommend you watch the 5 minute
                       <a href="#">Getting started</a> video, which will introduce you to the key basics of currency
                       exchanges and trading on Coingi.com.

                    <p>
                        If you still have your orders hanging in the orderbook, try cancelling the order and placing a new one
                        closer to the opposite side of the orderbook, or just wait until the order gets filled by another
                        user at the current price.
